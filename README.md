# Memory-game-using-C++-
My 1st ever game that I coded my for school project in 2018

The project has been developed using Turbo C++

This is a simple game in c++. In this game random colours will be displayed which the player should memorize in the exact order. Later the graphical houses of different colours will be displayed among which the player has to choose the right one.
